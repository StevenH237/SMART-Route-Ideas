Today's route idea is a connection from Wixom through Walled Lake to Troy, connecting those cities to Oakland Mall and Somerset, six days per week.

More details are available on [this page](/smart-route-ideas/new-routes/785), but for your convenience, an image of the map is available below.

This route map is hosted on Felt, but is included below as an image only. It is not screen reader accessible, but the information it conveys is available on the aforementioned details page.

In the above map, the thicker orange line represents the eastbound routing, and the thinner blue line represents the westbound routing. The widths are only different so that both lines are visible where they overlap. Black circles indicate timepoints served on all trips, and green triangles indicate timepoints served on selected trips only.
