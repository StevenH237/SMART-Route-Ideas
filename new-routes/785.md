Route 785 would provide new service to downtown Wixom as well as Walled Lake, and more easterly service to Henry Ford Medical Center in West Bloomfield, mainly via Wixom Rd, Pontiac Trail, Maple Rd, and Big Beaver Rd east of Coolidge, with diversions to Somerset, Henry Ford Medical Center, and Commerce Crossings. Troy Transit Center and Grand Haven Towers would be served on selected trips only.

Note that as part of this idea, route 780 Fifteen Mile would be shortened, operating only east of Telegraph.

This route would run six days a week.

# Interactive Route Map
The below route map is hosted on Felt. It is not screen-reader accessible, but the information it conveys is available later in the page.

In the above map, the thicker orange line represents the eastbound routing, and the thinner blue line represents the westbound routing. The widths are only different so that both lines are visible where they overlap. Black circles indicate timepoints served on all trips, and green triangles indicate timepoints served on selected trips only.

# Routing summary and select trips differences
From Wixom Meijer to Oakland Mall via Grand River, Wixom, Pontiac Trail, Maple, Commerce Crossings, Loop, Center, Haggerty, Maple, Ring, Maple, Coolidge, Golfview, Lakeview, Big Beaver, and John R.

## Troy Transit Center
Troy Transit Center was involved in lawsuits that resulted in SMART being limited to taking 18 buses through the Center per day. Therefore, it would be served on selected trips of both this and 780, with no service from the nearby 460 or 461 as those routes already meet the Wolverine at the Royal Oak and Detroit stations respectively.

*Eastbound trips* of route 785 would pull into the Transit Center on the trip 10-70 minutes before the times of trains 351, 353, and 355 to Chicago, with service possibly not running early enough for 351.

*Westbound trips* of route 785 would pull into the Transit Center on the **two** trips immediately following trains 350 and 352 from Chicago, with service not likely running late enough for 354.

Combined with 780 doing the same (but with directions reversed, such that westbound service connects to Chicago-bound trains, and Pontiac-bound trains connect to eastbound service), there would be 12 to 14 buses entering the train station per day, six days per week.

## Grand Haven Towers
Grand Haven Towers is currently served by route 780 once per half day per direction, including on Saturdays. Service would be added to one late-morning westbound trip and one evening eastbound trip on the 785, without removing any from the 780.
