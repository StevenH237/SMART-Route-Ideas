I'm Steven! I've been a SMART rider since May 2011. I have expressed many frustrations about this system before. One of my longest-running complaints has been places the system doesn't go, and I've had ideas for improvements to the service since before my first year was even up.

Back when I started riding SMART, they had several routes to Downtown Detroit all day every day. The last such service was on December 11, 2011; as of December 12, four of those routes completely lost any Downtown service and the other seven were restricted to serving it peak hours only with poorly timed transfers to DDOT outside of it. A modicum of this damage was mitigated January 1st, 2018 when SMART introduced FAST, five all-day daily express routes from the suburbs into Downtown Detroit (and one peak-only express route from Macomb's suburbs to Wayne State University). Then it was made worse on March 23 and 30, 2020 when SMART, immediately after promising that cuts to service due to the pandemic would "maintain existing geographic route coverage", eliminated all peak-hour Downtown service. Some of this has since been restored, some of it has not.

Service I have wanted to see since the first year of riding includes trips on Evergreen or Mound. Within three years, I also added Hayes as a daily service. Now I've got more ideas for FAST, additional crosstowns, 24-hour routes, regional service, and more. In fact, I even have my own transit systems (websites to come). With exceptions to the whole-cloth systems, I'm hoping to catalog everything here and maybe one day work on making some of these ideas a reality.
